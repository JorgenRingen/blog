title: "Java8: Stream and Lambda code kata"
date: 2015-06-04

I just added a code kata for learning the Stream and Lambda API's in Java 8.

The purpose of a kata is to repeat a simple exercise over and over again, making small improvements for each iteration, until you basically can do the exercise blind folded.
I find this to be one of the most effective ways to improve basic coding skills and to learn new things.

Feel free to fork and submit your own "perfectionized" solution.
