I just added a [code kata](https://github.com/JorgenRingen/stream-lambda-kata) for learning the Stream and Lambda API's in Java 8.

The purpose of a kata is to repeat a simple exercise over and over again, making small improvements for each iteration, until you basically can do the exercise blind folded.
I find this to be one of the most effective ways to improve basic coding skills and to learn new things.

Feel free to fork and submit your own "perfectionized" solution.
